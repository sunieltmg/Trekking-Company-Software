<h1>Trekking-Company-Software</h1>

<b>Introduction</b><br>

<p align="justify">Adventure Everest Team Treks & Expedition is a leading trekking agency in Nepal
and was facing a lot of problems in maintaining trekking details. They were tired of
traditional register book record system and were thinking of upgrading to digital
platform. So, as per their I have built digital software (Adventure Everest Team
Treks and Expedition record keeping system) that can easily manage details of
permit, peak, employee and bills. This will save a lot of their time, energy and
money.
Our system was created using powerful python language which consists of a lot of
built in libraries and modules. It follows OOP (Object Oriented Language) concept
and include features like generalization and encapsulation. A relational database
MySQL is used for storing and manipulating data.</p>

<p align="justify">PyCharm (Popular IDE for
Python) is used as text-editor to write and debug code. We have used a lot of python
modules like tkinter, math, random, MySQL connector, OS, unit test and time.
List of Functionalities available in our software are given below:<br>
  <b>1) Admin</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Login</li>
    <li>Change Password</li>
    <li>Assign Role</li>
    <li>Delete Employee</li>
    <li>Manage Bill</li>
    <li>Add/Update/Delete/Search/Peak</li>
    <li>Login</li>
  </ul><br>
  
  <b>2) Employee</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Register</li>
  <li>Login</li>
  <li>Add/Update/Delete/Search/Permit</li>
  <li>Generate Bill</li>
  </ul>

</p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p align="Justify">
The “Adventure Everest Team Treks and Expedition record keeping system”
completely fulfils all the requirement of our assignment. The code has become
reusable, flexible and easier to debug with the implementation of OOP concept.
MySQL (Relational database) is used to store and manipulate data as it is fast and
free. In order to create attractive interface easily python popular tkinter module was
used. Likewise, for avoiding unexpected errors and to prevent whole system from
crashing exceptional handling was used. Unit-testing of every module was done and
checked to avoid error in future. Finally, binary searching was used to increase
searching speed and reduce time complexity.</p><br>
